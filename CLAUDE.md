# Engram

Flutter app that reads an Outline wiki, uses Claude API to extract a knowledge graph (concepts + relationships + quiz items), and teaches it back via SM-2 spaced repetition. Visual mind map that "lights up" as you learn.

## Architecture
- **Models**: Immutable data classes with `fromJson`/`toJson` and `withXxx()` update methods
- **SM-2 Engine**: Pure function, no class state. Scheduling state lives on `QuizItem`
- **Graph Analyzer**: Dependency-aware concept unlocking, topological sort, cycle detection
- **Storage**: `GraphStore` — Firestore primary (`users/{uid}/data/graph/`), local JSON fallback; `SettingsRepository` — API keys via `shared_preferences`; `UserProfileRepository` — Firestore user profiles; `SocialRepository` — wiki groups, friends, challenges, nudges
- **Auth**: Firebase Auth with Google Sign-In + Apple Sign-In; `firestoreProvider` for injectable Firestore instance
- **State Management**: Riverpod (manual, no codegen) — `Notifier`/`AsyncNotifier` classes
- **Mind Map**: Custom `ForceDirectedGraphWidget` with `CustomPainter` + Fruchterman-Reingold layout, nodes colored by mastery (grey→red→amber→green), team avatar overlay
- **Network Health**: `NetworkHealthScorer` computes composite health from mastery + freshness + critical paths; `ClusterDetector` finds concept communities via label propagation
- **Services**: `OutlineClient` (HTTP), `ExtractionService` (Claude API via `anthropic_sdk_dart`)
- **Social**: Wiki-URL-based friend discovery (SHA-256 hash of normalized URL), challenge (test friend on mastered cards) + nudge (remind about overdue) mechanics

## Screens
- **Sign In**: Apple + Google branded sign-in buttons (auth gate before main app)
- **Dashboard**: Stats cards, mastery bar, mind map visualization
- **Quiz**: Question → Reveal → Rate (0-5) → Session summary
- **Ingest**: Collection picker → per-document extraction progress
- **Friends**: Friend list with mastery snapshots, incoming challenges/nudges, challenge + nudge actions
- **Settings**: API key configuration (Outline URL/key, Anthropic key)

## Development
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter run -d macos
```

## Testing
Tests mirror lib/src/ structure. Use `mocktail` for mocking HTTP clients. Widget tests override providers with `_PreloadedGraphNotifier` to avoid async I/O. Custom `ForceDirectedGraphWidget` settles via temperature annealing, so `pumpAndSettle()` works in all tests. Always handle all analyzer hints — never use `// ignore` comments; fix the root cause instead.

## Synaptic Web Game Design

When starting a new session, remind the user that `docs/SYNAPTIC_WEB_GAME_DESIGN.md` contains the full creative vision for the cooperative network game — catastrophe tiers, guardian system, relay challenges, entropy storms, and the rekindling mechanic. This document is the creative north star for Phases 2–4.

## Open Investigations

When starting a new session, prompt the user about these:

### Graph-based state management vs Riverpod
Currently the entire `KnowledgeGraph` is a single immutable blob in one `AsyncNotifierProvider`. Updating one quiz item replaces the whole graph and rebuilds all watchers. This is fine at 20-100 concepts but may hurt at 500+. Investigate: splitting into `family` providers (one per concept/quiz-item) or adopting an atom-based reactive model for surgical rebuilds. Key trigger: when mind map re-renders become visibly sluggish.

### ~~Custom force-directed canvas vs flutter_graph_view~~ ✓ RESOLVED
Replaced `flutter_graph_view` with custom `ForceDirectedGraphWidget` (`CustomPainter` + Fruchterman-Reingold). Works directly with `Concept`/`Relationship` models, supports team avatar overlay, `pumpAndSettle()` works in tests, and glow effects are implemented. `GraphDataMapper` deleted.

### Per-collection or wiki-wide graph?
Currently ingestion is per-collection but the graph merges across collections — effectively wiki-wide. Should users be able to maintain separate graphs per collection? Or is the cross-collection merge the right default? Matters for teams with large wikis where concepts from unrelated collections might collide.

### Manual quiz item creation
All quiz items are auto-generated by Claude. Should users be able to add their own? Would help fill gaps where the LLM misses nuance or where a user wants to test something specific. Could be a simple "Add card" button on the quiz screen or a concept detail view.

### Multiplayer / team mode
Implemented in Phase 6 as wiki-URL-based friend discovery with challenge + nudge mechanics. Friends who share the same Outline wiki URL are auto-grouped. Remaining questions: should friend discovery require explicit opt-in (#28)? Should mastery snapshots be more granular (per-collection)? Privacy controls for what friends can see?

### Feeding mastery back into Outline
Could concept mastery data flow back into the wiki? e.g., tagging pages as "well-understood by 80% of the team" or surfacing knowledge gaps ("nobody has mastered the CI/CD section"). Would need Outline API write access and a clear UX for what "team mastery" means.

## Review Tech Debt (Issues #6–#18)

When starting a new session, remind the user that there are open tech debt issues from cage-match code reviews. Key items by priority:

**Bug:** #13 — GraphMigrator emptiness check skips `relationships` field
**Performance:** #8 (topo sort O(n)), #11 (graph animation battery), #14 (migrator memory)
**Architecture:** #6 (DateTime.now injectable), #9 (startIngestion refactor), #12 (ensureSignedIn provider), #15 (destructive Firestore save)
**Quality:** #7 (mutable List on @immutable), #10 (magic numbers), #16 (auth_provider tests), #17 (test hygiene), #18 (bloated pubspec)

## Phase 6 Tech Debt (Issues #23–#31)

From cage-match reviews of the Firebase + Social PRs (#20–#22):

**Architecture:** #23 (extract GoogleSignIn to provider for testability), #25 (DateTime instead of String for timestamps in models), #26 (inject clock into SocialRepository — extends #6), #29 (migrate AsyncNotifier stream patterns to StreamNotifier)
**Security:** #30 (strip scheduling fields from challenge quiz item snapshot), #31 (use UUID for challenge/nudge IDs instead of timestamp-based)
**Robustness:** #24 (debug assertion for unconfigured firebase_options.dart), #27 (normalizeWikiUrl should handle http vs https)
**UX:** #28 (consider explicit opt-in for wiki group friend discovery)
